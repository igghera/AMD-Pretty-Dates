AMD-Pretty-Dates
================

An AMD compliant module for readable dates in JavaScript.

Based on the brilliant <a href="https://github.com/zachleat/Humane-Dates/">Humane-Dates from zachleat</a>, this is just a wrapper around his library, to make it AMD ready, so you can use it in your projects with Require.js or any other module-based environment.
